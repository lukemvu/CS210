3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Model a Percolation System): 
    - forgot to implement corner cases, googled how to throw an exception and implemented it
    - ran into issues with encode function not encoding the right numbers, threw print statements
      throughout the code to see where the issues where and found that N was not properly giving the
      right value
    - to address backwash problem realized using two uf objects would allow to find connections from
      drain to source and a second for purely the source, this way a full block would be connected to both
      source drain and just source

   Problem 2 (Estimate Percolation Threshold): 
   - forgot to implement corner cases after submission, fixed with resubmissions
   - ran into some issues with data types from int to doubles when calculating the ratios
   - forgot to initialize the double array
   -
